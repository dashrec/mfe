// We're gonna first put down the name of the file that was created, and then a hash of the contents of the file.
// When we set mode to production that's gonna cause webpack to run slightly differently. It's gonna make sure that all the JavaScript files that are built get somewhat optimized.
//We need to add a script to our package.json file to make sure that we can actually build everything for production.  - > "build": "webpack --config config/webpack.prod.js"
